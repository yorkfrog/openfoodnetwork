# Changing this file
# ==================
#
# You are welcome to fix typos, add missing translations and remove unused ones.
# Here are some guidelines to make sure that this file is becoming more beautiful
# with every change we do.
#
# * Change text: No problem. Fix the typo. And please enclose the text in quotes
#   to avoid any accidents.
#
#   Example 1: "When you're using double quotes, they look like \"this\""
#   Example 2: "When you’re using double quotes, they look like “this”"
#
#   The second example uses unicode to make it look prettier and avoid backslashes.
#
# * Add translations: Cool, every bit of text in the application should be here.
#   If you add a translation for a view or mailer, please make use of the nested
#   structure. Use the "lazy" lookup. See: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#looking-up-translations
#
#   Avoid global keys. There are a lot already. And some are okay, for example
#   "enterprises" should be the same everywhere on the page. But in doubt,
#   create a new translation and give it a meaningful scope.
#
#   Don't worry about duplication. We may use the same word in different contexts,
#   but another language could use different words. So don't try to re-use
#   translations between files.
#
#   Don't move big parts around or rename scopes with a lot of entries without
#   a really good reason. In some cases that causes a lot of translations in
#   other languages to be lost. That causes more work for translators.
#
# * Remove translations: If you are sure that they are not used anywhere,
#   please remove them. Be aware that some translations are looked up with
#   variables. For example app/views/admin/contents/_fieldset.html.haml looks
#   up labels for preferences. Unfortunately, they don't have a scope.
#
# * Participate in the community discussions:

  modal_hubs: "Food Hubs"
  modal_hubs_abstract: Our food hubs are the point of contact between you and the people who make your food!
  modal_hubs_content1: You can search for a convenient hub by location or name. Some hubs have multiple points where you can pick-up your purchases, and some will also provide delivery options. Each food hub is a sales point with independent business operations and logistics - so variations between hubs are to be expected.
  modal_hubs_content2: You can only shop at one food hub at a time.

  modal_groups: "Groups / Regions"
  modal_groups_content1: These are the organisations and relationships between hubs which make up the Open Food Network.
  modal_groups_content2: Some groups are clustered by location or council, others by non-geographic similarities.

  modal_how: "How it works"
  modal_how_shop: Shop the Open Food Network
  modal_how_shop_explained: Search for a food hub near you to start shopping! You can expand each food hub to see what kinds of goodies are available, and click through to start shopping. (You can only shop one food hub at a time.)
  modal_how_pickup: Pick-ups, delivery and shipping costs
  modal_how_pickup_explained: Some food hubs deliver to your door, while others require you to pick-up your purchases. You can see which options are available on the homepage, and select which you'd like at the shopping and check-out pages. Delivery will cost more, and pricing differs from hub-to-hub. Each food hub is a sales point with independent business operations and logisitics - so variations between hubs are to be expected.
